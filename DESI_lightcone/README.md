# modelling_spectro_sys for DESI lightcones
The codes in this directory is for implementing ELG spectroscopic systematics on DESI-data-like catalogues and compute the two-point correlation function and power spectra. ```make_LSS.sh``` scripts is the first code to execute. We get the ```*full_HPmapcut.dat.fits``` catalogues from DESI data directory, making our own large-scale structure catalogues. ```compute_2pt.sh``` scripts are for the two-point correlation function and power spectra computation for uncontaminated galaxy mocks and catastrophics contaminated mocks. The default setting is with thetacut=0.05 and window function computation.
