# modelling_spectro_sys
This is a code to implement the spectroscopic systematics on uncontaminated galaxy mocks (galaxy mocks without systematics). This includes applying the catastrophic failures modelled by DESI DR1 ELGs ()[], and redshift uncertainty of SDSS ([Yu et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516...57Y/abstract)) and DESI tracers ([Yu et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.527.6950Y/abstract)) on galaxy mocks in boxes or in a lightcone. We assume a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. 

There is a toturial jupyter notebook for your reference: spectroscopic_systematics.ipynb
